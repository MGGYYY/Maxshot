## Why Maxshot AI Matters？

**Harnessing the Power of AI to Transform DeFi: Addressing Challenges with Innovative Solutions**

## The Challenges of DeFi Today

Despite significant innovation, today’s DeFi infrastructure faces fundamental limitations that restrict scalability, efficiency, and user adoption.

### **Fragmented and Slow Strategy Development**

Designing, testing, and maintaining DeFi strategies remains resource-intensive. Each new strategy requires bespoke engineering, repeated audits, and manual oversight—slowing innovation and limiting accessibility.

### **Fragile Multi-Chain Architecture**

Interacting across chains introduces substantial complexity. Integrations are brittle, expensive to maintain, and prone to desynchronization or execution failure. This fragility restricts both developers and users from accessing the best opportunities across ecosystems.

### **Expanding Security Surface from Upgrades**

Traditional DeFi systems must update smart contracts frequently to remain competitive. Every upgrade increases the security surface, requiring costly audits and creating ongoing operational risk.

### **High User Friction Across Chains**

Users must manage gas, bridging, network selection, protocol risk, and fragmented liquidity. This multi-step friction results in a poor experience, especially for non-technical users, and prevents DeFi from scaling to a broader audience.

### **Absence of a Unified Intelligence Layer**

There is no coordinated decision-making or automation layer across DeFi. Strategies operate in isolation, without shared intelligence, leading to inefficient capital deployment and opportunities left on the table.

---

## FAQ

**Quick answers to common questions about Maxshot’s features and how to get started.**

### **How Do I get Started?**

Users can get started by depositing supported assets into Maxshot AI-managed vaults, gaining access to automated, cross-chain yield optimization with a single deposit.

---

### **Is There Any Deposit Cap?**

Yes. For security and risk management reasons, Maxshot applies deposit caps on supported chains during the initial launch phase. These limits may be adjusted over time based on system performance, market conditions, and overall protocol stability.

---

### **What Are ‘Transferable and Cross-Chain Deposit Certificates’?**

When users deposit assets, they receive deposit certificates (“shares”) that represent their position in the vault.

These shares increase in value over time and can be transferred or moved cross-chain at any time on supported networks, based on the LayerZero OFT standard.

---

### **How Do Withdrawals Work?**

Maxshot uses an asynchronous (delayed) withdrawal mechanism.

When a withdrawal is requested, the user’s shares are deducted based on the current share price. Once the underlying funds are ready, the user can claim their assets.

---

### **How Are Yields Calculated and Rewards Distributed?**

Maxshot calculates yields and rates of return at **fixed intervals** (currently every 24 hours, subject to change).

Additional rewards from underlying protocols (e.g., liquidity mining incentives such as $MORPHO) may be periodically converted into the underlying asset to enhance overall returns.

---

### **Is There a Risk of Temporary Liquidity Shortage?**

While Maxshot maintains idle liquidity to meet normal withdrawal demand, there may be situations where assets deployed in underlying strategies are temporarily unavailable. In such cases, withdrawal requests may experience longer processing times.

---

### **Does Maxshot Guarantee Profits?**

Maxshot is designed to intelligently optimize returns through AI-driven, risk-aware strategies across DeFi markets. While profits are never guaranteed, our always-on agents continuously adapt to market conditions, helping users pursue smarter, more efficient yield opportunities over time.

---

### **Do Users Retain Custody of Their Funds?**

Yes. User funds are always held in smart contracts.

AI agents can submit execution instructions but never take custody or unilateral control of user assets.

---

### **How Can Maxshot Be Integrated?**

Maxshot is designed for easy integration and broad accessibility. Developers and third-party platforms can embed its functionality directly, while users enjoy a consistent one-click experience across interfaces.

- **SDKs and Widgets:** Embed Maxshot vaults into apps, wallets, and dashboards.
- **AI Portal Integration:** Integrate Maxshot features into AI assistants (e.g., wallet chatbots with built-in yield optimization).
- **One-Click Access:** Users can interact with the same vault seamlessly across different AI portals, wallets, and interfaces.

---

### How Does Maxshot Handle Fees & Rewards?

Fees and rewards are handled **fairly and transparently**, making it easy for users to understand exactly how their earnings grow.

| **Mechanism** | **How It Works** | **Key Benefit** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Performance Fee** | Applied only on profits, never on initial deposits. Configurable by governance (can be set to 0%). | Users only pay when they earn; fair and transparent. |
| **Rewards Distribution** | Protocol collects yields from underlying markets and distributes them proportionally to all share holders via share token value. | Rewards are automatic, proportional, and seamless. |
| **Idle Buffer** | A small portion of deposits held in reserve to support instant withdrawals, even during high demand. | Improves liquidity & user experience while slightly reducing overall yield. |

---

### **What Is MaxPoint?**

MaxPoint is Maxshot’s native engagement and reward system designed to measure, incentivize, and reward meaningful participation across the Maxshot ecosystem.

MaxPoints are earned by users, developers, and partners for contributing value - such as using Maxshot AI vaults, developing tools, engaging with or promoting Maxshot on social platforms, and supporting ecosystem growth. They serve as a transparent way to recognize on-chain and off-chain activity and align incentives across stakeholders.

MaxPoints may be used to unlock future benefits within the Maxshot ecosystem, including priority access, eligibility for rewards, partner incentives, and participation in upcoming launches. MaxPoints do not represent ownership, equity, or guaranteed financial returns.

# Security

## Core Safeguards and Guardrails

**The security architecture is built on a multi-layered approach to ensure all capital remains protected.**

Maxshot’s security framework ensures robust protection for all capital, employing multi-layered safety mechanisms to guard against operational or workflow errors.

Even with its autonomous operations, Maxshot incorporates strong governance and safety protocols, including a clear separation of duties between AI agents and human oversight, ensuring transparency, security, and resilience.

### Walled Garden Asset Restriction (Mandatory Guardrail)

- **Principle:** All crypto assets are strictly walled within whitelisted protocols.
- **Mechanism:** The system’s Execution Agent is cryptographically restricted by the smart contracts to interact only with a limited set of addresses and protocols explicitly approved by the Strategy Oversight function. Any attempt to send assets to a non-whitelisted address—even due to a strategy or workflow error—will result in the transaction failing at the smart contract level, preventing capital loss outside the approved investment universe.

### Timed Execution with Guardian Veto

- **Mechanism:** For any on-chain strategy actions that are potentially risky (like large rebalances, cross-chain transfers, or whitelisting updates), Maxshot utilizes a time-lock delay.
- **Process:** When an execution is initiated, there is a delay (a “gray period”) during which Oversight Agents (Guardians) and the community can review the pending action. If something looks harmful, the Guardian can veto/cancel the action within this critical window. This provides necessary time for human-in-the-loop intervention before execution.

### Transparency & Proof of State

- **Mechanism:** All of Maxshot’s operations maintain proof-of-state across chains. Vault balances, deposits, yields earned, and overall allocations are continuously recorded and verifiable by anyone.
- **Benefit:** Users and community members can always audit the vault’s current state and historical performance on-chain, ensuring that everything the automated system does is observable and auditable.
