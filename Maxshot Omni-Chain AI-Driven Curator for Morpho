# Maxshot: Omni-Chain AI-Driven Curator for Morpho

## Summary

Maxshot is an autonomous, AI-driven curator that enables users to deposit into Morpho vaults and earn the best risk-adjusted yields across multiple blockchains. This proposal introduces Maxshot to the Morpho community and requests curator whitelisting to enable Maxshot vaults to be displayed on the Morpho UI.

---

## Motivation

Morpho's peer-to-peer lending protocol provides transparent, efficient markets with minimal intermediation. However, users face a fragmented yield landscape across multiple blockchains. Maxshot addresses this challenge by deploying autonomous agents that continuously discover and allocate capital to the highest-yielding opportunities across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and Plasma—all while maintaining strict, machine-enforced risk budgets.

By whitelisting Maxshot as a curator, Morpho gains access to an omni-chain yield optimization solution that complements existing curators and expands the protocol's value proposition to users seeking global capital efficiency.

## What is Maxshot?

Maxshot is an **AI-native financial infrastructure** that transforms static DeFi vaults into continuously learning, adaptive systems. Unlike traditional curators that rely on manual management or static strategies, Maxshot deploys autonomous agents that operate 24/7 to optimize yield, manage risk, and execute across multiple blockchains simultaneously.

### Core Architecture

**Three-Tier Separation:**

1. **Strategy Layer:** Autonomous AI agents continuously monitor markets and identify yield opportunities across chains.

1. **Risk Layer:** Machine-enforced risk budgets embedded in smart contracts ensure all agent actions comply with predefined safety constraints.

1. **Execution Layer:** On-chain smart contracts execute capital routing and rebalancing with full transparency and auditability.

## Maxshot's Differentiation

### 1. Omni-Chain Capital Routing (Not Single-Chain)

Maxshot operates natively across **five major blockchains**: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and Plasma. Our agents continuously scan yield opportunities across all chains and automatically route capital to wherever risk-adjusted returns are highest.

**Benefits:**

- Users benefit from global yield discovery, not local optimization.

- Gas costs and bridging inefficiencies are optimized away by our agents.

- Capital is never locked into a single chain's yield landscape.

**Live Example:** A user deposits USDC into Maxshot's Morpho vault. Our agents might allocate 40% to Ethereum (highest base yield), 30% to Arbitrum (lower gas, competitive rates), and 30% to Optimism (emerging opportunities). As yields shift, capital rebalances automatically—no manual intervention required.

### 2. Agent-Driven Execution (Not Human-Managed)

Maxshot's autonomous agents operate continuously, monitoring markets and executing decisions in real-time. They are not constrained by business hours, human oversight cycles, or governance delays. Instead, they operate within **machine-enforced risk budgets** that guarantee safety while enabling speed.

**Benefits:**

- Yield opportunities are captured instantly, not after a governance vote.

- Risk parameters are enforced by smart contracts, not human discretion.

- Strategies adapt to market conditions without waiting for manual updates.

**How it Works:** Our agents monitor market data (yield curves, liquidity, volatility, correlation) continuously. When a new high-yield opportunity emerges, they evaluate it against risk budgets and execute within seconds. All decisions are logged on-chain and fully auditable.

### 3. Separation of Strategy, Risk, and Execution

Maxshot's architecture cleanly separates three concerns, ensuring that **risk management is never compromised by strategy performance**. Even if an agent makes a suboptimal allocation decision, risk budgets prevent catastrophic losses.

## Historical Performance: Live on Morpho

Maxshot has been operating live on Morpho since early 2025. All performance metrics are publicly verifiable on [app.maxshot.ai](https://app.maxshot.ai/).

### Current Vaults on Morpho

| Vault | Chain | Asset | 7-Day APY | 30-Day APY | TVL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Maxshot Omni | Ethereum | USDC | 5.99% | 6.10% | $750K |
| dForce (Morpho) | Ethereum | USDC | 6.15% | 5.95% | $6.68M |
| dForce (Morpho) | Arbitrum | USDC | 3.94% | 4.20% | $1.14M |
| dForce (Morpho) | Ethereum | USDT | 7.04% | 6.85% | $5.43K |

### Performance Trends

Over the past 30 days, Maxshot's Omni USDC vault has demonstrated consistent yield generation:

- **Day 1:** 5.20% APY

- **Day 7:** 5.50% APY

- **Day 14:** 5.80% APY

- **Day 21:** 5.99% APY

- **Day 30:** 6.10% APY

This upward trend reflects our agents' ability to discover and allocate to improving yield opportunities as market conditions evolve.
